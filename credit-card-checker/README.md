# Credit Card Checker / The Luhn Algorithm 

This is just one of many intro JS  projects I completed as part of [CodeCademy's](https://www.codecademy.com) __*Full Stack Web Developer Career Path*__


## Project Goals ðŸ›¹
*via CodeCademy:*

>Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but youâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing! 

---------------
>Instructions:  
* Create a function, validateCred() that has a parameter of an array. The purpose of validateCred() is to return true when an array contains digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid. This function should NOT mutate the values of the original array.

* To find out if a credit card number is valid or not, use the Luhn algorithm. Generally speaking, an algorithm is a series of steps that solve a problem â€” the Luhn algorithm is a series of mathematical calculations used to validate certain identification numbers, e.g. credit card numbers. The calculations in the Luhn algorithm can be broken down as the following steps:

* Starting from the farthest digit to the right, AKA the check digit, iterate to the left.
* As you iterate to the left, every other digit is doubled (the check digit is not doubled). If the number is greater than 9 after doubling, subtract 9 from its value.

* Sum up all the digits in the credit card number.
* If the sum modulo 10 is 0 (if the sum divided by 10 has a remainder of 0) then the number is valid, otherwise, itâ€™s invalid.
...

_code snippet:_

```JavaScript
function validateCred(arr) {
  let newArray = [];
  for (let i = arr.length-1; i>=0; i--) {
    let x = arr[i]
    if ((arr.length-1 - i) % 2 === 1) {
      //console.log(i);
      x *= 2;
      if (x > 9){
        x -= 9;
      }
    }
    newArray.unshift(x);
  }
  
  let sum = newArray.reduce((acc, cv) => acc + cv);
  //console.log(newArray)
  //console.log(sum)
  return sum % 10 === 0;
}
```
